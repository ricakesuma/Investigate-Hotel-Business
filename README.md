# Investigate Hotel Business

# Business Insight

In this Mini Project, I acted as a member of the Data Scientist team in a hotel company. As a member of the Data Scientist team, I have the responsibility to provide insights related to the hotel's business performance. These insights can be sought by data exploration, such as analyzing how customers behave in booking hotel tickets or looking for factors that affect the cancellation of hotel ticket bookings. Then present the insights that have been obtained using visualization and data story telling.
